# Jelly Roll
Jelly Roll is a single player, story driven computer game written in Java, played with the [Leap Motion Sensor](https://www.leapmotion.com/), and run using [Processing](https://www.processing.org/). 

The game starts when Jelly (a blob of jelly) comes into contact with peanut butter, which he is very allergic to. He starts to become sick and needs to find his way to a hospital. The player holds her hand above the leap motion sensor and moves it up-down and side-to-side to draw a platform for Jelly to ride on as he makes his way from the kitchen, through a park, and to his hospital bed where he can be treated. A gameplay video can be seen [here](http://www.corbin-lee.com/JellyRoll/).
